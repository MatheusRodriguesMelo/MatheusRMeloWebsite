    <p>This website belongs to Matheus Rodrigues Melo. I'm college Student, currently I'm looking foward to get my degree in Electrical engineering. However that doesn't stop me to do my own projects. This website is one of them, I had no real prior knowledge on how to create websites. I'm doing this by myself for myself.</p>
    <p>The website is not the only project that I'm working. It is howver the one that I want to put a little more effort, and the reason is simple. I want this website to cotain all my progress and experience on this journey.</p>
    <p>therefore, everything here is subject to changes and improvement. For now, on the bottom will be all my projects starting from this one.</p>
