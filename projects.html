            <h2>The Website Project</h2>
            <h3>August, 2022 - Present</h3>
            <p class="list__item">
                The website project, this project is my attempt to build a website to display information about me and my projects.
                It is the first project in this list, due my recent idea to record everything I done so far. 
                For creating such a website I abstained of using pre-made websites or website builders. The original website can be 
                found on the following link: <a href="https://matheusrodriguesmelo.github.io/MatheusRMeloWebsite/index.html">MatheusRMeloWebsite</a>.

            <h2>Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)</h2>
            <h3>August, 2022 - Present</h3>
            <p class="list__item">
                This is my most recent project. I learned by researching intensively that if I want to learn more about how the internet, 
                routers, Networks and computers works in general. that I should look into CCNA. of course, I'm aware that you don't have to get 
                a CCNA certification to learn the basic about those things. However, I personally want to go further, and a certification that proves 
                my dedication, doesn't sound like a bad idea.

            <h2>Conway's Game of Life (Python)</h2>
            <h3>August, 2022 - August, 2022</h3>
            <p class="list__item">
                Recently, I discovered something called "Game of Life", this game/simulation was invented by John Horton Conway in 1970.
                The concept is simple, it is a "zero player game" and there are two states, dead and alive. To be alive or dead, a cell check the neighbors,
                if the neighbors alive is more or less than a certain number, the cell dies. if a dead cell is surrounded by a key number of cells, it becomes alive. 
                it is a simple concept but very fun to code it. I'll probably do it in other programming language in the future.

            <h2>Ocelli: Astrobee's payload</h2>
            <h3>October, 2022 - May, 2023</h3>
            <p class="list__item">
                During my <a href= "https://www.fau.edu/engineering/senior-design/projects/spring2023/ocelli-astrobee-robots-thermal-data/">senior design showcase</a> 
                I Developed a prototype integrating a thermal camera with a microprocessor and buck converter module, into a compact housing anchored to the top of our depth camera. 
                We have successfully obtained high quality thermal images as well as a point cloud in the ROS framework, to allow for both calibration of the cameras, and tethering of the streams to create the thermal overlay.
